#lab01- website

https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/ii/labs/s2/01

This is a project made during the first class of my Applied Informatics course.

I created a website backend from a base html file given by the teacher using python and flask.

This website is just for practice only and contains no useful informations. I just played with
HTML/CSS and python.
